# History of the notion

# a brief history of predation in scientific publication

Elsevier, Springer, Nature, all predate public money by forcing scholars and their institutions to pay massive amounts of money to publish their papers, while the real added value, peer review process is massively done by researchers for free.

See George Monbiot (activitst, researcher and Guardian columnist) about the invention of this system by Robert Maxwell[[@monbiotScientificPublishingRipoff2018]]:


> The model was pioneered by the notorious conman Robert Maxwell. He realised that, because scientists need to be informed about all significant developments in their field, every journal that publishes academic papers can establish a monopoly and charge outrageous fees for the transmission of knowledge. He called [his discovery](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science) “a perpetual financing machine”. He also realised that he could capture other people’s labour and resources for nothing. Governments funded the research published by his company, Pergamon, while scientists wrote the articles, reviewed them and edited the journalsfor free. His business model relied on the enclosure of common and public resources. Or, to use the technical term, daylight robbery.


# The rise of open access journals and the Beall's list


They are predators, but not impersonators : in majority the papers that are submitted to these stakeholders are reviewed according to scientific standards.

What do we call a predatory open access publisher : a publisher who pretends to act as a real publisher (by running a true peer reviewing process), but does not and just takes your money. 

The growth of predatory open access publishers is linked to the devopment of open access itself and particularly the Gold road with publication fees. 
The Gold road does not mean that authors will have to pay [[APC]], but those predators we have mentioned above have made people understand that it was usually the case. 

A new market emerged and with it a new genre of crooks.
