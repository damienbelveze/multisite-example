  abstract = {While celebrity messaging is thought to be important in the design of public health campaigns, there is little work (a) decomposing the extent to which celebrity endorsement relies on directly authoring the content as opposed to passing on messages of others, (b) measuring how much explicitly citing public health authorities matters, and (c) examining whether these online messages are meaningfully received and digested offline. We address these three questions by conducting a large-scale randomized trial in Indonesia in 2015-2016, in which 46 high profile celebrities agreed to tweet or retweet messages promoting immunization. The decomposition shows that public health messages are 72\% more likely to be passed on when a celebrity is involved, but importantly, almost all of the effect (79\%) comes only when the celebrity authors the message themselves. Explicitly citing an external medical authority reduces the passing-on rate by 27\%. The results suggest that celebrities have an outsize influence in shaping public opinion on public health, particularly when they speak in their own voice.},

Drawing on web browsing data, archives of fact-checking websites, and results from a new online survey, we find: 1) social media was an important but not dominant source of election news, with 14 percent of Americans calling social media their “most important” source; 2) of the known false news stories that appeared in the three months before the election, those favoring Trump were shared a total of 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared 8 million times; 3) the average American adult saw on the order of one or perhaps several fake news stories in the months around the election, with just over half of those who recalled seeing them believing them; and 4) people are much more likely to believe stories that favor their preferred candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks.},

Drawing on research questioning the use of big data in social science and reception studies, we identify six misconceptions about misinformation and examine the conceptual and methodological challenges they raise. The first three misconceptions concern the prevalence and circulation of misinformation. First, the internet is not rife with misinformation or news, but with memes and entertaining content. Second, scientists focused on social media because it is methodologically convenient, but misinformation is not just a social media problem. Third, falsehoods don’t spread faster than the truth, how we define (mis)information influences our results and their practical implications. The second three misconceptions concern the impact and the reception of misinformation. First, people don’t believe everything they see on the internet: sheer volume of engagement should not be conflated with belief. Second, misinformation’s influence on people’s behavior is overblown since it often preaches to the choir. Third, people are more likely to be uninformed than misinformed, surveys overestimate misperceptions and say little about the causal influence of misinformation. To appropriately understand and fight misinformation, future research needs to address these challenges.},

The inventory of results which is organized according to three dimensions (performance, navigation, disorientation) leads to a set of convergent conclusions as well as to divergent conclusions. Prior knowledge provides resources to process non-linearity of documents. That is reflected by higher performance and navigation behaviors characterized by a higher level of elaboration. Nevertheless, studies focusing on nature of mental representations or constructed knowledge indicated a set of inconsistent results like results about disorientation. From this observation, limits, methodological and theoretical requirements are discussed. In conclusion, the necessity to conduct further research on relations between navigation, comprehension and dynamic of processes is stressed.},

  abstract = {Parental child-related spending represents an important pathway to promote children’s human capital development and material well-being. It is also, however, a pathway that perpetuates social inequalities given the well-known socioeconomic divide in parental spending on children. Although several studies have documented the extent to which current family income is associated with spending on children, we still know little about the causal effects of additional income on child-related spending across the socioeconomic strata. In this paper, I examine the effects of income gains due to universal and unconditional cash transfers from the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend on child-related spending. Using longitudinal household expenditure data from the 1996–2015 Consumer Expenditure Surveys, I exploit exogenous variation in the generosity of the Alaska Dividend to estimate short- and long-term disparities in parental expenditures resulting from payouts. Results provide a unique opportunity to compare the behavior of high- and low-income parents after an income boost. I find that low- and middle-income parents use cash transfers to catch up with their more affluent counterparts in the short and long term. Low-income parents are, however, unable to keep up with the long-term increases in child-related spending made by their middle-income counterparts. Implications of results for the reproduction of socioeconomic inequalities and for current and proposed cash-transfer policies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Promulguée en 2016, la loi pour une République numérique1 (LRN) comporte plusieurs mesures sur lesquelles vient s’appuyer la politique nationale de science ouverte. Ces mesures sont transposées, notamment, dans le Code de la recherche et dans le Code régissant les relations entre le public et l'administration (CRPA). Le présent guide vise à proposer des recommandations pour l’application de ces mesures. En particulier, il propose des éléments d’interprétation de l'article 30 de la loi (devenu article L. 533-4 du Code de la recherche2), qui est connu pour être une disposition majeure en matière de publication des écrits scientifiques (alinéas I et III), en ce qu’il instaure un droit pour les chercheurs au dépôt de leurs publications en archive ouverte, moyennant le respect de certaines conditions. Cet article comporte également des précisions, peut-être moins connues, relatives aux données de recherche en tant que telles (alinéa II). L’intérêt majeur de l’article L. 533-4 du Code de la recherche est qu’il vise des situations de production et de réutilisation des données scientifiques dans un contexte partenarial. La relation de cet article avec les dispositions du CRPA fixant le périmètre de l’« open data3 » des données publiques (principes et exceptions à leur ouverture et à leur réutilisation, cas particuliers, issus de l’article 6 de la LRN) est proposée comme fil directeur de ce guide. Ce guide vient préciser les travaux antérieurs, notamment Ouverture des données de la recherche. Guide d'analyse du cadre juridique en France de 20174 et Guide d’application de la loi pour une République numérique (article 30) Écrits scientifiques5 de 2018, dans un contexte d’évolution constante de la réglementation, notamment au niveau européen.},

Avant tout outil d’aide à la gestion des données d’un projet de recherche et à la définition de bonnes pratiques, il s’agit également d’un livrable à usage externe, dont la rédaction est exigée par de nombreux financeurs de la recherche. L’ANR (depuis 2019) et la Commission européenne (depuis 2014), entre autres, exigent des chercheurs qui soumettent une demande de financement qu’ils fournissent un plan de gestion détaillé des données de recherche qu’ils comptent utiliser. Ce document témoigne de la bonne gestion des données au cours du projet et il permet de déterminer quelles données de recherche pourront être mises à la disposition du plus grand nombre, dans un souci de transparence scientifique et de partage des savoirs. Mais à quoi ressemble exactement un PGD ? Quelles sont les informations indispensables à y inscrire ? Existe-t-il des modèles ? Comment inscrire ce travail chronophage dans un projet de recherche et le valoriser ? Est-ce vraiment bien utile ? \#\#\# Objectifs Cette formation vise à présenter en détails le concept de « plan de gestion des données » et à expliciter en quoi ce document, qui peut apparaître à première vue comme un fardeau administratif supplémentaire, peut en réalité apporter de nouvelles pistes de réflexion dans la recherche. L’objectif de cette journée est de permettant aux producteurs de données de s’interroger sur les bonnes pratiques à adopter à toutes les étapes de leur projet, qu’il s’agisse d’un projet financé ou d’une thèse de doctorat. La formation sera également l’occasion de découvrir les nombreuses ressources et outils qui sont à la disposition des doctorants et des chercheurs pour faciliter leur rédaction, ainsi que les options qui s’offrent à eux pour valoriser ce travail.~ À l’issue de la formation, le stagiaire sera capable de : 1.~~ ~Donner une définition de ce qu’est un plan de gestion des données 2.~~ ~Citer les questions auxquelles doit répondre un PGD 3.~~ ~Discerner les cas dans lesquels la rédaction d’un PGD est obligatoire de ceux dans lesquels il n’est qu’utile 4.~~ ~Comprendre en quoi la rédaction d’un PGD participe du mouvement de la science ouverte (open science) 5.~~ ~Utiliser l’outil DMP-OPIDoR pour rédiger un plan de gestion des données 6.~~ ~Connaître les critères selon lesquels la Commission européenne évalue un PGD, et auto-évaluer son propre PGD 7.~~ ~Donner une définition de ce que sont un data paper et un data journal, et savoir où trouver de telles ressources \#\# PROGRAMME 1.~~ ~Quelques rappels sur les données de la recherche 2.~~ ~Le PGD en théorie : définition et modèles 3.~~ ~Le PGD en pratique : guide de rédaction et étude de plans rédigés 4.~~ ~Le PGD en pratique : un retour d’expérience de rédaction 5.~~ ~Boîte à outils : prise en main de DMP OPIDoR 6.~~ ~Valoriser son PGD : introduction aux data papers \#\# PRÉ-REQUIS Savoir utiliser un navigateur web. Cette formation est destinée aux personnes déjà un peu familières du concept de données de la recherche, quel que soit leur degré d’avancement dans leurs travaux de recherche.~ \#\# TYPE D'INTERVENTION Exposé, démonstration, travaux pratiques, échanges \#\#\# Logistique - Vidéo-projecteur : support de présentation - Activités : exercices à imprimer ou à faire en ligne si la salle est équipée \#\# SOURCES Les images de ce dépôt sont créditées dans le support de formation.

  abstract = {Pourquoi les théories complotistes séduisent-elles autant ? Collègues, amis, parents... Les discours conspirationnistes progressent dans tous les milieux et entrent aujourd'hui dans notre sphère intime. Notre premier réflexe : contredire. Or cela ne fait que renforcer les croyances de notre interlocuteur. Mais qui peut se résigner à voir certains de ses proches basculer dans le complotisme ? Comment réagir sans rompre le fil du dialogue ? Cela passe par l'écoute. Une gageure, tant la discussion est viciée, mais c'est à la portée de chacun. La preuve : William Audureau, journaliste au Monde, média honni des complotistes, a réussi à gagner la confiance de stars et d'anonymes de la complosphère pour nouer avec eux un dialogue au long cours. Antivax, « spécialistes » du 11-Septembre et des sociétés secrètes, adeptes de la naturopathie en lutte contre Big Pharma ou sympathisants du mouvement QAnon : ils lui ont tous parlé à coeur ouvert. Le résultat est une plongée fascinante au coeur de la mécanique de pensée conspirationniste et de son pouvoir d'attraction. Riche de portraits éclairants et nourri d'analyses des meilleurs spécialistes, ce livre dévoile les nombreux chemins qui mènent au complotisme. Et ceux qui permettent d'en sortir.

  abstract = {A journal article dataset has been developed with metadata of articles by France-based authors in the period 2013-2020. The purpose of this dataset was to form a basis for the retrospective and prospective analyses of the total costs of APCs paid by French institutions. APCs are the article processing charges (APCs) that researchers must pay to have their articles published in some open access journals. The main results of the retrospective analysis of the dataset regarding the numbers of APC-paid articles with a France-based corresponding author: - the total cost of APCs has tripled in the period 2013-2020. The major driver is the growth of articles in Gold OA journals, i.e. fully open access journals with APCs (without this growth, the APC cost would have been multiplied by 1,69 instead of 3) - the journal publishers and dissemination platforms have been categorised in four tiers, each publishing between 20\% and 32\% of all articles with a French co-author in 2020: tier 1 with the top publisher (Elsevier), tier 2 with three publishers, tier 3 with 16 publishers and tier 4 with the long tail of publishers (n=1995). The highest growth rate of APC-paid articles by France-based corresponding authors is seen in journals published by tier 2 publishers (Springer Nature, Wiley and MDPI) - more than three quarters of the APC-paid articles by France-based corresponding authors are in the fields of biology and medical research. The main observation regarding the price evolution of the APCs is that the APC-level for HybridOA articles started in 2013 at a high level (2 453 € in average) but have been stable over the years with 2 488 € in average in 2020. The APC-level for articles in Gold journals started considerably lower with an average APC in 2013 of 1 395 €. However, a rapid increase in the level of APCs for Gold OA articles has been observed, with an average APC of 1 745 € in 2020. This has led to a calculation of the total cost of APCs paid by French institutions between 2013 and 2020. In addition to the above-mentioned article dataset, 2019 and 2020 data from the ERE survey by Couperin (the national consortium of research performing organizations that negotiates with publishers the prices and conditions of access to research publications for the benefit of its members) were analysed in order to assess the total subscription costs of journal packages for French institutions. This data was compiled in Microsoft Power BI with additional information about the categories of the products, the publisher tiers, and the respondents to both surveys. This resulted in an estimate of ca. 87,5 M€ for the total expenditure on journal packages by all Couperin members in 2020. An analysis by Couperin of the ERE surveys 2014-2021 showed that the price increases per year in this period varied between -1,95\% and +7,22\% with an average price increase of 1,76\% per year. The evolution of the total journal subscription costs based on this average annual growth rate results in an estimated 97,5 M€ in 2030. Using known and trusted data from our dataset (i.e. excluding articles for which the country of the corresponding author could not be determined, or whose APC price could not be precisely estimated), we developed mixed-effects models of APC prices as a function of other articles’ features. These models were used to predict the evolution of the total cost of APCs for the period 2021-2030, in various situations,: - under the assumption of continuing and unchanged trends. The predicted cost of APCs in 2030 is 50,6 M€, whereas the total expenditure on journal subscriptions would be 97,5 M€ - for a scenario with an acceleration towards Gold OA, the predicted cost of APCs in 2030 is 68,7 M€; - and for a scenario with increase of Green OA and a transition from HybridOA towards Gold, the predicted cost of APCs in 2030 is 38,5 M€. Finally, a situation was simulated where 90\% of all articles by France-based corresponding authors would be Gold OA (and 10\% would be published in Diamond OA journals) in order to assess the cost ceiling of such a 100\% open access situation. In this case the predicted cost of APCs in 2030 is 168,7 M€.},

At three such enriched habitats in Monterey Bay, CA, at a depth of nearly 3000 m, we observed pycnogonids (sea spiders) of at least two species, Colossendeis gigas and C. japonica, feeding on sea anemones that were commonly found there. Submersible remotely operated vehicles provided direct observations of feeding, as well as high definition video and photographic images. We recorded the co-occurrence of both pycnogonids and prey anemones during ten of 12 visits during 2002–2006. Anemones and pycnogonids were conspicuously more abundant at these oases than in the surrounding benthos. The sedentary anemone Anthosactis pearseae was attached directly to whalebones while the pom-pom anemone, Liponema brevicornis, was found resting on soft sediment, rolling in benthic currents, or accumulating where these currents were disrupted by topography, as at whale falls, wood falls, and clam fields. Both pycnogonid species were observed feeding on these anemones, either as predators or as micropredators.},

  abstract = {A major factor underlying several of scholarship's most pressing problems is its antiquated journal system with its trifecta of reproducibility, affordability and functionality crises. Any solution needs to not only solve the current problems but also be capable of preventing a takeover by corporations. Technically, there is broad agreement on the goal for a modern scholarly digital infrastructure: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies of current journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding further vendor lock-in. Redirection of funding from the legacy publishers to the new framework may be realized by a tried-and-tested incentive system: Funding agencies have ensured minimum standards at funded institutions by requiring specific infrastructures. These requirements, updated to include the new framework, provide exquisite incentives for institutions to redirect their infrastructure funds from antiquated journals to modern technology. At the same time and enabled by this plan, new, modern and adaptable reputation systems, long demanded by the scientific community, can finally be implemented. Ownership involves socially recognized economic rights, first and foremost the exclusive control over that property, with the self-efficacy it affords. The inability to exert such control over crucial components of their scholarly infrastructure in the face of a generally recognized need for action for over three decades now, evinces the dramatic erosion of real ownership rights for the scholarly community over said infrastructure. Thus, this proposal is motivated not only by the now very urgent need to restore such ownership to the scholarly community, but also by the understanding that through their funding bodies, scholars may have an effective and proven avenue at their disposal to identify game-changing actions and to design a financial incentive structure for recipient institutions that can help realize the restoration of ownership, with the goal to implement open digital infrastructures that are as effective and as invisible as their non-digital counterparts.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 accelerated a decade-long shift to remote work by normalizing working from home on a large scale. Indeed, 75\% of US employees in a 2021 survey reported a personal preference for working remotely at least one day per week1, and studies estimate that 20\% of US workdays will take place at home after the pandemic ends2. Here we examine how this shift away from in-person interaction affects innovation, which relies on collaborative idea generation as the foundation of commercial and scientific progress3. In a laboratory study and a field experiment across five countries (in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia), we show that videoconferencing inhibits the production of creative ideas. By contrast, when it comes to selecting which idea to pursue, we find no evidence that videoconferencing groups are less effective (and preliminary evidence that they may be more effective) than in-person groups. Departing from previous theories that focus on how oral and written technologies limit the synchronicity and extent of information exchanged4–6, we find that our effects are driven by differences in the physical nature of videoconferencing and in-person interactions. Specifically, using eye-gaze~and recall measures, as well as latent semantic analysis, we demonstrate that videoconferencing hampers idea generation because it focuses communicators on a screen, which prompts a narrower cognitive focus. Our results suggest that virtual interaction comes with a cognitive cost for creative idea generation.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity citizen science projects are growing in number, size, and scope, and are gaining recognition as valuable data sources that build public engagement. Yet publication rates indicate that citizen science is still infrequently used as a primary tool for conservation research and the causes of this apparent disconnect have not been quantitatively evaluated. To uncover the barriers to the use of citizen science as a research tool, we surveyed professional biodiversity scientists (n=423) and citizen science project managers (n=125). We conducted three analyses using non-parametric recursive modeling (random forest), using questions that addressed: scientists' perceptions and preferences regarding citizen science, scientists' requirements for their own data, and the actual practices of citizen science projects. For all three analyses we identified the most important factors that influence the probability of publication using citizen science data. Four general barriers emerged: a narrow awareness among scientists of citizen science projects that match their needs; the fact that not all biodiversity science is well-suited for citizen science; inconsistency in data quality across citizen science projects; and bias among scientists for certain data sources (institutions and ages/education levels of data collectors). Notably, we find limited evidence to suggest a relationship between citizen science projects that satisfy scientists' biases and data quality or probability of publication. These results illuminate the need for greater visibility of citizen science practices with respect to the requirements of biodiversity science and show that addressing bias among scientists could improve application of citizen science in conservation.},

Il suffirait d'écouter les experts pour devenir heureux. L'industrie du bonheur, qui brasse des millions d'euros, affirme ainsi pouvoir façonner les individus en créatures capables de faire obstruction aux sentiments négatifs, de tirer le meilleur parti d'elles-mêmes en contrôlant totalement leurs désirs improductifs et leurs pensées défaitistes. Mais n'aurions-nous pas affaire ici à une autre ruse destinée à nous convaincre, encore une fois, que la richesse et la pauvreté, le succès et l'échec, la santé et la maladie sont de notre seule responsabilité ? Et si la dite science du bonheur visait à nous convertir à un modèle individualiste niant toute idée de société ? Edgar Cabanas et Eva Illouz reconstituent ici avec brio les origines de cette nouvelle " science " et explorent les implications d'un phénomène parmi les plus captivants et inquiétants de ce début de siècle (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {La crise des médias et la défiance des citoyens envers l'information grandissent chaque jour et notre conviction est que cette situation n’a rien d’inéluctable. La confiance peut être regagnée en traitant le problème à la racine : la propriété des médias. Comment les citoyens peuvent-ils accorder leur confiance aux médias si aucune règle claire n’empêche un actionnaire d’interférer dans le fonctionnement des rédactions ou de faire licencier un journaliste qui lui déplaît ? Doit-on se satisfaire d'une situation dans laquelle une poignée d'industriels possèdent la quasi-totalité des médias, limitant le pluralisme d’opinions et appauvrissant d’autant le débat public ? Est-il acceptable que les journalistes ne soient pas consultés lorsque leur titre est vendu à tel ou tel « mécène » ? Il n’existe pas de fatalité à ce que les médias se vident de leurs journalistes au fil de leurs rachats successifs par des industriels. L’information est un bien public dont la production doit être confiée à des journalistes disposant d’une véritable indépendance éditoriale, et nous pensons que cette indépendance est possible en adoptant de nouvelles règles. Ce livre vise à armer les citoyens, les journalistes et les régulateurs en faisant toute la lumière sur les différentes formes de propriété des médias et les limites des régulations existantes. Il ne s’agit pas de questions techniques, mais des fondamentaux d’un débat démocratique éclairé. Pour cela, nous proposons une loi de démocratisation de l'information permettant aux journalistes et aux citoyens de reprendre enfin le contrôle des médias. Des médias indépendants gouvernés de manière démocratique et tournés vers la production d’une information de qualité. Rejoignez-nous dans ce combat ! (éditeur)},

Brillant fonctionnaire de la SS – il termine la guerre comme Oberführer (général) –, il nourrit la réflexion nazie sur l’adaptation des institutions au Grand Reich à venir – quelles structures et quelles réformes? Revenu à la vie civile, il crée bientôt à Bad Harzburg un institut de formation au management qui accueille au fil des décennies l’élite économique et patronale de la République fédérale : quelque 600 000 cadres issus des principales sociétés allemandes, sans compter 100 000 inscrits en formation à distance, y ont appris, grâce à ses séminaires et à ses nombreux manuels à succès, la gestion des hommes. Ou plus exactement l’organisation hiérarchique du travail par définition d’objectifs, le producteur, pour y parvenir, demeurant libre de choisir les moyens à appliquer. Ce qui fut très exactement la politique du Reich pour se réarmer, affamer les populations slaves des territoires de l’Est, exterminer les Juifs. Passé les années 1980, d’autres modèles prendront la relève (le japonais, par exemple, moins hiérarchisé).

  abstract = {It is often argued that cost-sharing—charging a subsidized, positive price— for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that costsharing induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to \$0.60 (i.e., from 100\% to 90\% subsidy), a price still \$0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.}

  abstract = {Efforts to make research results open and reproducible are increasingly reflected by journal policies encouraging or mandating authors to provide data availability statements. As a consequence of this, there has been a strong uptake of data availability statements in recent literature. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what proportion of these statements actually contain well-formed links to data, for example via a URL or permanent identifier, and if there is an added value in providing such links. We consider 531, 889 journal articles published by PLOS and BMC, develop an automatic system for labelling their data availability statements according to four categories based on their content and the type of data availability they display, and finally analyze the citation advantage of different statement categories via regression. We find that, following mandated publisher policies, data availability statements become very common. In 2018 93.7\% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2\% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository—rather than being available on request or included as supporting information files—are a fraction of the total. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8\% of PLOS publications and 12.2\% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. We also find an association between articles that include statements that link to data in a repository and up to 25.36\% (± 1.07\%) higher citation impact on average, using a citation prediction model. We discuss the potential implications of these results for authors (researchers) and journal publishers who make the effort of sharing their data in repositories. All our data and code are made available in order to reproduce and extend our results.},

  abstract = {With WhatsApp’s adoption of the Signal Protocol as its default, end-to-end encryption by the masses happened almost overnight. Unlike iMessage, WhatsApp notifies users that encryption is enabled, explicitly informing users about improved privacy. This rare feature gives us an opportunity to study people’s understandings and perceptions of secure messaging pre- and post-mass messenger encryption (pre/post-MME). To study changes in perceptions, we compared the results of two mental models studies: one conducted in 2015 pre-MME and one in 2017 post-MME. Our primary finding is that users do not trust encryption as currently offered. When asked about encryption in the study, most stated that they had heard of encryption, but only a few understood the implications, even on a high level. Their consensus view was that no technical solution to stop skilled attackers from getting their data exists. Even with a major development, such as WhatsApp rolling out endto-end encryption, people still do not feel well protected by their technology. Surprisingly, despite WhatsApp’s end-to-end security info messages and the high media attention, the majority of the participants were not even aware of encryption. Most participants had an almost correct threat model, but don’t believe that there is a technical solution to stop knowledgeable attackers to read their messages. Using technology made them feel vulnerable.},

Il s’agira ici de s’interroger sur le lien entre « connaissance », « adhésion » et « transmission » dans les théories du complot et les rumeurs à travers deux études empiriques. Peut-on connaître et transmettre sans adhérer ? Peut-on connaître et adhérer sans transmettre ? Peut-on adhérer et transmettre sans réellement « connaître » ?, Conspiracy theories and rumors, as forms manifesting “social thought” (Rouquette, 1973), share processes and functions. The few studies dealing specifically with the question of belief in rumors questioned the link between adhesion and transmission (Allport \& Lepkin 1943; Rosnow, 1991; Guerin \& Miyazaki, 2006). The aim here will be to question the link between « knowledge », « adhesion » and « transmission » in conspiracy theories and rumors through two empirical studies. Can we know and transmit without adhering to? Can one know and adhere to without transmitting? Can we adhere to and transmit without actually « knowing »?},

Selon le dictionnaire d'Oxford, qui en a fait son mot de l'année, le terme désignerait des « circonstances dans lesquelles les faits objectifs ont moins d'influence pour former l'opinion publique que l'appel à l'émotion et aux croyances personnelles ». Ce livre prend le parti de retourner à la source de cet état des lieux et l'identifie dans le concept de « bullshit » théorisé par le philosophe Harry Frankfurt en 1986. Ce qu'il a défini comme une « indifférence à l'égard de la vérité » distincte du mensonge s'avère en effet un outil conceptuel remarquablement efficace pour saisir comment l'opinion prétend l'emporter sur la vérité et pour comprendre le succès des impostures scientifiques et des « théories du complot ». L'ère de la~post-vérité est bien celle du bullshit institué à une échelle globale, et seule une compréhension fine de ce phénomène permettra d'engager la lutte qui se prépare. Heureusement, une telle science du bullshit est en fait déjà disponible, mais il restait à l'assembler en un seul volume accessible, utile et stimulant.},

  abstract = {There are different citation habits in the research fields that influence the obsolescence of the research literature. We analyze the distinctive obsolescence of research literature in disciplinary journals in eight scientific subfields based on cited references distribution, as a synchronous approach. We use both negative binomial (NB) and Poisson distributions to capture this obsolescence. The corpus being examined is published in 2019 and covers 22,559 papers citing 872,442 references. Moreover, three measures to analyze the tail of the distribution are proposed: (i) cited reference survival rate, (ii) cited reference mortality rate, and (iii) cited reference percentile. These measures are interesting because the tail of the distribution collects the behavior of the citations at the time when the document starts to get obsolete in the sense that it is little cited (used). As main conclusion, the differences observed in obsolescence are so important even between disciplinary journals in the same subfield, that it would be necessary to use some measure for the tail of the citation distribution, such as those proposed in this paper, when analyzing in an appropriate way the long time impact of a journal.},

  abstract = {The definition of scholarly content has expanded to include the data and source code that contribute to a publication. While major archiving efforts to preserve conventional scholarly content, typically in PDFs (e.g., LOCKSS, CLOCKSS, Portico), are underway, no analogous effort has yet emerged to preserve the data and code referenced in those PDFs, particularly the scholarly code hosted online on Git Hosting Platforms (GHPs). Similarly, the Software Heritage Foundation is working to archive public source code, but there is value in archiving the issue threads, pull requests, and wikis that provide important context to the code while maintaining their original URLs. In current implementations, source code and its ephemera are not preserved, which presents a problem for scholarly projects where reproducibility matters. To understand and quantify the scope of this issue, we analyzed the use of GHP URIs in the arXiv and PMC corpora from January 2007 to December 2021. In total, there were 253,590 URIs to GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket, and GitLab repositories across the 2.66 million publications in the corpora. We found that GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, and Bitbucket were collectively linked to 160 times in 2007 and 76,746 times in 2021. In 2021, one out of five publications in the arXiv corpus included a URI to GitHub. The complexity of GHPs like GitHub is not amenable to conventional Web archiving techniques. Therefore, the growing use of GHPs in scholarly publications points to an urgent and growing need for dedicated efforts to archive their holdings in order to preserve research code and its scholarly ephemera.},

Son culte a pour principe divin le Marché, dont l’appétit n’est apaisé que par la croissance. Il a pour valeur cardinale la liberté d’entreprendre, pour idéal l’équilibre et pour credo l’infinitude du monde, condition à la satisfaction des dieux. Il a ses temples, ces Bourses où valsent les indices, reflets des humeurs divines. Il a ses rites de consommation ; il a son clergé – la finance – et ses archiprêtres – les banquiers centraux, seuls capables d’apaiser la colère des dieux. L’économie a acquis l’autorité dont était investie la religion.

Aux aguets sur les réseaux sociaux, des agences spécialisées visent le professeur de biologie de collège, blogueur et passeur de science, le citoyen ordinaire, le youtubeur, le micro-influenceur.

  author = {Friedhoff, Jane},
  abstract = {As mainstream games require increasingly larger technical teams and more complex software, there has been a move in the opposite direction: that is, the development of game-making tools that “are being designed with people who aren't professional coders in mind.” While Twine is not the only platform designed to facilitate the creation of interactive stories, it has evolved into the primary hotbed for games exploring personal experiences, especially those dealing with issues like marginalization, queerness, and discrimination. This paper examines Twine from a platform studies perspective to understand how it supports and facilitates more experimental works. The platform's development history, documentation, UI, method of content generation, and distribution model combine to create a tool that facilitates these kinds of works. Twine’s reference materials (oriented not toward code and problem solving, but to affirmation of the individual experience as the basis of a game), user interface (analogous to common brainstorming/writing techniques), orientation toward vignette (with the genre's subversive potential) and open distribution model (free to download, free to share, and exported as HTML) make the platform a uniquely-accessible tool for creating highly personal games. Analyzing Twine in this way allows game researchers to understand the importance of Twine’s design to the creation of such works, in turn illustrating factors that platform developers may use to guide future software.},

Les récentes polémiques autour des " déviations identitaires " et du supposé caractère idéologique des sciences sociales en sont des manifestations visibles. Cet essai interroge les notions d'engagement et de distanciation critiques en les situant dans l'histoire du temps présent, puis en envisageant trois moments où s'est posée la question de l'autonomie de l'université et des savoirs : l'affaire Dreyfus, Mai-Juin 1968, le mouvement de contestation de 2019-2020 contre la loi de programmation de la recherche. Cette mise en perspective conduit à appréhender plus généralement le rapport entre science et valeurs : en contestant les lectures dogmatiques des énoncés classiques d'Emile Durkheim et de Max Weber, ce livre invite à repenser l'idée de neutralité et à fonder autrement l'éthique de la discussion critique. Alors que de nouvelles approches académiques, soulignant l'imbrication des dominations, suscitent inquiétudes et rejet, les auteurs montrent qu'elles permettent de penser un universalisme pluriel pour la société d'aujourd'hui et de demain.

  abstract = {Depuis des décennies, les tenants de la pensée néolibérale mènent une guerre larvée contre le modèle social français de l'après-guerre. La résistance d'une population refusant des politiques en faveur du capital a abouti à un modèle mixte, intégrant des éléments néolibéraux plus modérés qu'ailleurs, et au maintien de plus en plus précaire d'un compromis social. A partir de la crise de 2008, l'offensive néolibérale s'est radicalisée, dans un rejet complet de tout équilibre. Emmanuel Macron apparaît alors comme l'homme de la revanche d'un capitalisme français qui jadis a combattu et vaincu le travail, avec l'appui de l'Etat, mais qui a dû accepter la médiation publique pour "civiliser" la lutte des classes. Arrivé au pouvoir sans disposer d'une adhésion majoritaire à un programme qui renverse cet équilibre historique, le président fait face à des oppositions hétéroclites mais qui toutes rejettent son projet néolibéral, largement à contretemps des enjeux de l'époque. Le pouvoir n'a ainsi d'autre solution que de durcir la démocratie par un excès d'autorité. Selon une méthode classique du néolibéralisme : de l'épuisement de la société doit provenir son obéissance.

Using Hardin’s Tragedy of the Commons, we show that an improper opening and enlargement of the digital environment (Infosphere) is likely to produce a Tragedy of the Digital Commons (TDC). In the course of the analysis, we explain why Adar and Huberman’s previous use of Hardin’s Tragedy to interpret certain recent phenomena in the Infosphere (especially peer-to-peer communication) may not be entirely satisfactory. We then seek to provide an improved version of the TDC that avoids the possible shortcomings of their model. Next, we analyse some problems encountered by the application of classical ethics in the resolution of the TDC. In the conclusion, we outline the kind of work that will be required to develop an ethical approach that may bridge the digital divide but avoid the TDC.},

  abstract = {Despite spectacular stories of successful cyber operations by law enforcement agencies, we continue to be extremely inefficient in fighting cybercrime. The research community has contributed many abstract models to guide digital forensic analyses, but these are usually too abstract to be helpful in concrete cybercrime investigations since they do not give an immediate and straightforward translation of a confronted (digital) crime scene into viable yet promising criminalistic actions. We propose a method to systematically bridge the gap between high-level process models and the demands of actual investigations. The idea is to encode phenomenon-specific knowledge of cybercrime into node-link representations, thereby literally mapping the digital crime scene in well-founded visual representations – so-called cognitive maps. These can be used to derive a prioritized plan of action for targeted acquisition and analysis of case-relevant artifacts. To illustrate our approach, we present a cognitive map for the category of botnet crime and evaluate it with the help of domain experts and by applying it to two real-world cases.},

Cognitive scientist Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data. In seventy-five graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing. Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature -- tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking -- which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation. Pinker makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress},

Nathalie HeinichNous pensions en avoir presque fini avec la contamination de la recherche par le militantisme. Mais le monde académique que nous dessinent les nouveaux chantres de l'identitarisme communautarisme n'a rien à envier à celui que s'étaient jadis annexé les grandes idéologies. Nos "universitaires engagés", trouvant sans doute que voter, manifester, militer dans une association ou un parti ne sont pas assez chics pour eux, tentent de reconquérir les amphithéâtres et leurs annexes. Obnubilés par le genre, la race et les discours de domination, ils appauvrissent l'Université de la variété de ses ressources conceptuelles. Qu'il soit la source ou l'écho de cette nouvelle dérive, décrite ici dans toutes ses aberrations, le monde social que ces chercheurs-militants s'attachent à bâtir s'avère à bien des égards invivable, habité par la hargne et le désir insatiable de revanche.},

Training is often organized on a grassroots level, offered by early career researchers, for early career researchers. Buffet style courses that cover many topics can inspire participants to try new things; however, they can also be overwhelming. Participants who want to implement new practices may not know where to start once they return to their research team. We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process.},

These systems can more readily meet volume, complexity, accessibility and preservation requirements than paper notebooks. Although the technology can yield many benefits, these can be realized only by choosing a system that properly fulfills the requirements of a given context. This review explores the factors that should be considered when introducing electronic laboratory notebooks to an academically focused research group. We cite pertinent studies and discuss our own experience implementing a system within a multidisciplinary research environment. We also consider how the required financial and time investment is shared between individuals and institutions. Finally, we discuss how electronic laboratory notebooks fit into the broader context of research data management. This article is not a product review; it provides a framework for both the initial consideration of an electronic laboratory notebook and the evaluation of specific software packages.},

  abstract = {Peer-review is a well-established cornerstone of the scientific process, yet it is not immune to status bias. Merton identified the problem as one in which prominent researchers get disproportionately great credit for their contribution while relatively unknown researchers get disproportionately little credit (Merton, 1968). We measure the extent of this effect in the peer-review process through a pre-registered field experiment. We invite more than 3,300 researchers to review a paper jointly written by a prominent author - a Nobel laureate - and by a relatively unknown author - an early-career research associate -, varying whether reviewers see the prominent author's name, an anonymized version of the paper, or the less well-known author's name. We find strong evidence for the status bias: while only 23 percent recommend “reject” when the prominent researcher is the only author shown, 48 percent do so when the paper is anonymized, and 65 percent do so when the little-known author is the only author shown. Our findings complement and extend earlier results on double-anonymized vs. single-anonymized review (Peters and Ceci, 1982; Blank, 1991; Cox et al., 1993; Okike et al., 2016; Tomkins et al., 2017; Card and Della Vigna, 2020) and strongly suggest that double-anonymization is a minimum requirement for an unbiased review process.},

Thereby, they are often misunderstood as an administrative task. Instead, DMPs are a powerful tool for efficient and secure collaboration and for the creation of research outputs of better quality and higher impact. A DMP will also help you to develop strategies for sharing and publishing your research data as openly as possible (and protecting them, when necessary). In this session, we will introduce the typical components of a DMP and discuss how the plan can be used actively throughout a research project. It will be targeted towards PhD students, but it will also be relevant for anyone working with research data.},

Using personnel data, we find that the absences of women below the age of 45 follow a 28-day cycle, while the absences of men and of women over the age of 45 do not. We interpret this as evidence that the menstrual cycle increases female absenteeism. To investigate the effect on women's earnings, we use a simple model of statistical discrimination. Consistent with the model, we find absenteeism has a more negative effect on men's earnings and this difference declines with seniority. The increased absenteeism induced by the 28-day cycle explains at least 14 percent of the earnings gender differential. (JEL J16, J22, J31)},

  abstract = {As science advances, the academic community has published millions of research papers. Researchers devote time and effort to search relevant manuscripts when writing a paper or simply to keep up with current research. In this paper, we consider the problem of citation recommendation by extending a set of known-to-be-relevant references. Our analysis shows the degrees of cited papers in the subgraph induced by the citations of a paper, called projection graph, follow a power law distribution. Existing popular methods are only good at finding the long tail papers, the ones that are highly connected to others. In other words, the majority of cited papers are loosely connected in the projection graph but they are not going to be found by existing methods. To address this problem, we propose to combine author, venue and keyword information to interpret the citation behavior behind those loosely connected papers. Results show that different methods are finding cited papers with widely different properties. We suggest multiple recommended lists by different algorithms could satisfy various users for a real citation recommendation system.},

Alors que la science est considérée comme universelle et que, libéralisation du commerce aidant, des efforts considérables sont consacrés à l’harmonisation des règles techniques, pourquoi ces différences se maintiennent-elles ? Notre analyse repose sur une étude comparative et transnationale de l’évaluation des biotechnologies, avec une focale sur les risques liés au clonage animal, en Europe et aux États-Unis. Quelles sont les connaissances produites en relation à un cadre réglementaire et institutionnel qu’elles contribuent à construire ? Nous identifions deux modes de production différenciés d’expertise scientifique dans lesquels la science réglementaire est plus ou moins centrale et qui associent différentes façons de produire de la connaissance (formes de raisonnement, traitement de l’incertitude, hiérarchie des sources de connaissance) et différentes façons de réguler les activités (architectures institutionnelles, ressources réglementaires, sources d’autorité). La production d’expertise s’avère donc prise dans l’ensemble des règles que forme cette « science réglementaire » qui, portant la marque des histoires nationales, entrave fortement les efforts d’harmonisation.},

  abstract = {This article examines the science-of-science-communication measurement problem. In its simplest form, the problem reflects the use of externally invalid measures of the dynamics that generate cultural conflict over risk and other policy-relevant facts. But at a more fundamental level, the science-of-science-communication measurement problem inheres in the phenomena being measured themselves. The “beliefs” individuals form about a societal risk such as climate change are not of a piece; rather they reflect the distinct clusters of inferences that individuals draw as they engage information for two distinct ends: to gain access to the collective knowledge furnished by science and to enjoy the sense of identity enabled by membership in a community defined by particular cultural commitments. The article shows how appropriately designed “science comprehension” tests—one general and one specific to climate change—can be used to measure individuals’ reasoning proficiency as collective-knowledge acquirers independently of their reasoning proficiency as cultural-identity protectors. Doing so reveals that there is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes over societal risks is the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and cultural-identity protectors at the same time.},

  abstract = {"Rumors may be the oldest medium of mass communication of information or ideas. Even before there were newspapers, radio, or television, rumors communicated by word-of-mouth made and shattered reputations, and set off riots and wars. Yet contrary to predictions, rumors continue to thrive, in spite of and parallel to mass media. What accounts for the puzzling persistence and continuing significance of this little-studied social phenomenon? Jean-No;el Kapferer examines the theory and practice of rumors, focusing on specific areas such as entertainment, criminal behavior, business and finance, and politics. He describes the kinds of conditions that give birth to rumors, why we believe them, and the hidden messages they convey. Kapferer points out that rumors frequently serve useful social purposes and present rich examples. He speculates about how rumors can be controlled, changed, and prevented. Drawing upon contributions of disciplines ranging from psychology to history, and integrating the insights of Europeans with the latest work of American researchers, this is the most comprehensive examination of rumors, gossip, and urban legends yet published. Translated into nine languages, this edition was updated with advances in theory and research since the book's original French publication in 1987. Its brisk, accessible style makes the book of interest to psychologists, economists, political scientists, sociologists, and folklore analysts, as well as the general reader who is curious about the origins of this fascinating social phenomenon."--Provided by publisher.},

While existing studies have attended to Islam’s engagement with capitalism, less attention has been given to the ideological intimacy of this relationship and, in particular, the increasing presence of radical free market thought in global Islamist politics, or what I have termed ‘libertarian Islamism’. The dominant narrative of Islamism, thus, constricts our understanding of the wider ideological ecology at play in the global political mobilization of Islam. While political Islam is often regarded as being rooted in a broadly leftist intellectual milieu, it has rather encapsulated variant conceptions of liberty, both left and right, and is currently undergoing what one might term a ‘free-market turn’. Within this milieu, a distinctly radical, anti-statist libertarian ideology has also emerged with an intimate relationship to conservative libertarian activists in the West. The presence of libertarian Islamism serves to recalibrate dominant understandings of ‘radical’ Islam and its purportedly fractious ideological relationship with the West.},

Menteur par vocation, par profession et par nécessité conjugale, il est l'heureux détenteur d'une double vie, entre son épouse et ses deux enfants à Vitoria, et sa maîtresse torride à Madrid. Pour l'heure, sa mission est de faire entrer dans le grand bain national le jeune élu local Javier Morodo, dont l'homosexualité assumée offrira un gaywashing au Parti, trop longtemps accusé d'homophobie. Tâche élémentaire pour Adrián, que vient compliquer la découverte inopinée de trois têtes coupées de conseillers municipaux artistement conservées dans des bonbonnes en cristal. Qui est derrière ces meurtres baroques ? Quel lien les rattache à une opération autour des palais en ruine qui constellent la cité basque ?

The majority of open access articles are published in a minority of journals that levy article processing charges (APCs) paid by authors or their institutions upon acceptance. Increases in APCs is proceeding at a rate three times that which would be expected if APCs were indexed according to inflation. As increasingly ambitious funder mandates are proposed, such as Plan S, it is important to evaluate whether authors show signs of price sensitivity in journal selection by avoiding journals that introduce or increase their APCs. Examining journals that introduced an APC 4-5 years after launch or when flipping from a subscription model to immediate open access model showed no evidence that APC introduction reduced article volumes. Multilevel modelling of APC sensitivity across 319 journals published by the four largest APC-funded dedicated commercial open access publishers (BMC, Frontiers, MDPI, and Hindawi) revealed that from 2012 to 2018 higher APCs were actually associated with increased article volumes. These findings indicate that APC hyperinflation is not suppressed through market competition and author choice. Instead, demand for scholarly journal publications may be more similar to demand for necessities, or even prestige goods, which will support APC hyperinflation to the detriment of researchers, institutions, and funders.},

These contributions come at a considerable cost: U.S. academic libraries paid \$1.7 billion for serial subscriptions in 2008 alone. Library budgets, in contrast, are flat and not able to keep pace with serial price inflation. We have investigated the publishers' value proposition by conducting a comparative study of pre-print papers and their final published counterparts. This comparison had two working assumptions: 1) if the publishers' argument is valid, the text of a pre-print paper should vary measurably from its corresponding final published version, and 2) by applying standard similarity measures, we should be able to detect and quantify such differences. Our analysis revealed that the text contents of the scientific papers generally changed very little from their pre-print to final published versions. These findings contribute empirical indicators to discussions of the added value of commercial publishers and therefore should influence libraries' economic decisions regarding access to scholarly publications.},

Une femme et sa fille sont assassiné au nom de Dieu par des fondamentalistes mormons ayant reçu un " ordre de dieu ".Utah. Une petite ville plantée dans le sillage de Salt Lake City, le fief de l'Église mormone. Le 24 juillet 1984, Allen Lafferty, mormon pratiquant, rentre chez lui après sa journée de travail, dans la maison qu'il habite avec sa jeune épouse et leur bébé de quinze mois. Quand il pousse la porte, l'horreur l'attend : Brenda et sa petite fille ont été sauvagement égorgées. En un instant, Allen est convaincu qu'il connaît les coupables. Et pour cause, ce sont ses frères. À la barre des mois plus tard, Ron et Dan Lafferty ne nieront pas les faits. Pas plus qu'ils n'exprimeront le moindre remords. Les deux Lafferty sont des prophètes, Dieu parle à travers eux, il leur chuchote ses ordres. Pour eux, l'État n'existe pas. L'école ? Une machination. La médecine ? Un charlatanisme. Ron et Dan Lafferty ont quitté le giron des mormons pour embrasser une foi chrétienne radicale, dont l'un des piliers n'est autre que la polygamie. Et Brenda Lafferty avait commis l'erreur d'y être opposée...},

Lorsque nous venons au monde, nous sommes jetés sur un territoire : l'État nous envoie des papiers que nous n'avons pas demandés et nous dit : tu m'appartiens. L'expérience politique n'est pas celle de la constitution et du consentement. C'est celle de la capture et de la soumission à la volonté de l'autre. Le sujet politique ne saurait dès lors être perçu comme un sujet qui contracterait ou qui délibèrerait. C'est d'abord un territoire occupé à qui la Loi vient de l'extérieur." La théorie politique ne cesse d'ordinaire de penser à travers des abstractions : le contrat social, la citoyenneté, la souveraineté populaire, la volonté générale... Mais comment la réalité apparaît-elle sitôt que l'on rompt avec ces fictions ? Geoffroy de Lagasnerie répond en déployant une approche qu'il appelle "réductionniste", qui le conduit à faire vaciller les oppositions classiques entre démocratie et colonie, force légitime et violence illégitime, État de droit et arbitraire... Un ouvrage qui renouvelle profondément les cadres de la théorie politique. (4e de couverture)},

Il nous faut accepter la chute, que l'on s'en désespère ou que l'on y trouve une jouissance coupable. Autrement dit, "il n'y a pas d'alternative" - comme le disait en son temps Margaret Thatcher. Or il y a une alternative. Il y en a même de très nombreuses, car ailleurs la catastrophe est déjà arrivée et a déjà donné naissance à des mobilisations politiques et écologiques. Le catastrophisme, cette construction récente qui touche les classes moyennes occidentales, c'est un "récit du Tout ", un récit dépolitisé qui nous encourage à nous prendre en charge de manière privée. Or, c'est en politisant l'écologie et en adoptant un point de vue local que nous verrons se rouvrir les possibilités d'action, dans leur : pluralité.

  abstract = {"En travail. Conversations sur le communisme" : c'est le titre du livre récemment publié par Bernard Friot et Frédéric Lordon aux éditions La Dispute, fruit d'échanges entre ces deux figures de la pensée de gauche organisés au printemps dernier par Amélie Jeammet.  Avec Julien Théry, qui les reçoit pour Le Média, les deux auteurs reviennent sur leurs points d'accord, qui portent sur l'essentiel : le communisme réel ne peut se développer ni en fuyant l'économie, les institutions et toute et la sphère de la production capitaliste dans des dissidences, ni en s'en remettant à un futur mythique et messianique. Bernard Friot s’intéresse à la poursuite de la construction d’institutions alternatives au capitalisme : salaire à vie, propriété d’usage, souveraineté sur l’investissement. Frédéric Lordon développe une philosophie spinoziste des institutions, après avoir, comme économiste, analysé le capitalisme financiarisé. Leurs trajectoires scientifiques et militantes sensiblement différentes n’en convergent pas moins sur la nécessité d’une proposition communiste qui donnerait à une mobilisation générale l’appui de figures et de réalisations concrètes. Il fallait une authentique rencontre intellectuelle, avec ce qu’elle suppose de confrontation fraternelle des idées, pour aboutir ainsi à cette mise en travail du communisme. ▶ Ni actionnaire, ni publicité, Le Média TV est indépendant et ne vit que de vos dons :  👉 https://www.lemediatv.fr/soutien ▶ Soutenez Le Média :  👉 https://www.lemediatv.fr/soutien 👉 https://www.okpal.com/le-media/ 👉 https://fr.tipeee.com/le-media ✅  Suivez-nous :  Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/lemedia\_tv/ Facebook : http://bit.ly/FacebookLeMedia Twitter : http://bit.ly/TwitterLeMedia Youtube : http://bit.ly/YouTubeLeMedia Peertube : https://video.lemediatv.fr Telegram :  https://t.me/LeMediaOfficiel Rejoignez la communauté des Socios !},

The way in which PowerPoint is used and the form it takes differs between faculties. The present article aims to evaluate the impact of the provision of slides on student academic performance and attendance (regardless of test scores). For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was carried out with two intrasubject manipulated learning situations in which copies of slides created by teachers were, or were not, made available to students prior to class sessions. Additionally, student academic engagement and study strategies were assessed using two scales in order to analyse whether these variables modified the relationship between access to slides and academic performance. Outcomes revealed that access to slides developed by teachers had a negative impact on student performance and attendance to classes. Student academic engagement and study strategies were found to modify the relationship between academic performance and access to slides.},

In this paper, I argue that it’s no accident that conspiracy theorists value lay research on expert topics: such research is likely to undermine knowledge, via its effects on truth and justification. Accepting expert testimony is a far more reliable route to truth. Nevertheless, lay research has a range of benefits; in particular, it is likely to lead to greater understanding, even when it does not lead to knowledge. I argue that we can reap most of the genuine benefits of lay research while minimizing the risks by engaging in exploratory, rather than truth-directed, inquiry. To engage in exploratory inquiry is to engage dogmatically, expecting to be unable to confirm the expert view or to disconfirm rivals.},

  abstract = {Communisme ou barbarie, l’alternative est à nouveau sous nos yeux, peut-être même l’est-elle pour la première fois à ce degré d’acuité. Cette fois c’est la planète elle-même qui nous somme. Ou plutôt la planète telle que nous nous la rendons à nous-mêmes inhabitables. Sur ce front-là, on ne tergiverse pas, on ne négocie pas, on n’atermoie pas. Le changement climatique est en marche et, pour la première fois, la Covid-19 nous a fait apercevoir que nous n’aurions pas seulement à en souffrir les canicules, les épisodes météorologiques extrêmes ou les pieds dans l’eau, mais également la libération de virus dont celui qui nous met presque à genoux en ce moment est sans doute l’un des plus «~bénins~».~Posée l’urgence de la situation, c’est l’urgence de penser la situation qui est posée avec elle. Mais peut-être «~penser~» n’est-il pas le mot le plus approprié quand il s’agit de donner le plus de chances à la bonne branche de la bifurcation. «~Imaginer~» pourrait être meilleur. Car la politique, dès lors qu’elle n’a pas pour seule ambition de reconduire l’ordre des choses à l’identique, au moment même où elle fait face à l’obligation impérieuse de faire advenir du radicalement différent, la politique, donc, est affaire d’imagination, au sens littéral du mot~: d’offrir des images. Ou des figures. Aller vers un avenir suppose de s’en être donné des figures.~C’est ce que ce livre s’essaye à faire, à partir d’une position de principes fondamentaux, dont le premier énonce qu’une société communiste a pour devoir de relever les individus de la précarité, de les libérer de l’angoisse des lendemains dans laquelle le marché capitaliste, qui détient toutes les données de leur reproduction matérielle, les plonge inévitablement – et l’effrayante crise sociale qui s’annonce à la suite de la crise sanitaire se chargera d’en donner l’illustration. L’instrument de cette libération s’appelle «~la garantie économique générale~». Elle est directement inspirée des travaux de Bernard Friot sur le «~salaire à vie~». Et se pose très explicitement la question d’un nouveau mode de production, c’est- à-dire des nouveaux rapports sociaux propres à soutenir une division du travail développée en ses multiples échelles~: du local au global.~Sous cette condition, tous les rapports sociaux peuvent être repensés – et en l’occurrence les rapports du capitalisme abolis~: rapport salarial, rapports de propriété privée des moyens de production, rapports financiers. C’est ici qu’aident les figures : à donner des images de ces perspectives constamment renvoyées au registre de «~l’utopie~». Là où les figurations progressent, les disqualifications par l’utopie s’effacent.~Mais ça n’est pas tout d’avoir des figures~: il faut aussi imaginer les trajectoires politiques qui permettent de les rejoindre. Au moins en poser les données fondamentale~: le type de résistance que la bourgeoisie opposera à la disparition de son monde, le type de dynamique politique que cette résistance appellera, le type de bloc social à constituer pour prévaloir, notamment les alliances à passer entre luttes anticapitalistes et luttes antiracistes, enfin la manière dont se redéploie la question internationaliste.},

Car il nous promet la «\,vie sans\,»\,: sans institutions, sans État, sans police, sans travail, sans argent – «\,ingouvernables\,». La fortune de ses énoncés recouvre parfois la profondeur de leurs soubassements philosophiques. Auxquels on peut donner la consistance d’une «\,antipolitique\,», entendue soit comme politique restreinte à des intermittences («\,devenirs\,», «\,repartages du sensible\,»), soit comme politique réservée à des virtuoses («\,sujets\,», «\,singularités quelconques\,»). Soit enfin comme politique de «\,la destitution\,». Destituer, précisément, c’est ne pas réinstituer – mais le pouvons-nous\,? Ici, une vue spinoziste des institutions répond que la puissance du collectif s’exerce nécessairement et que, par «\,institution\,», il faut entendre tout effet de cette puissance. Donc que le fait institutionnel est le mode d’être même du collectif. S’il en est ainsi, chercher la formule de «\,la vie sans institutions\,» est une impasse. En matière d’institution, la question pertinente n’est pas «\,avec ou sans\,?\,» – il y en aura. C’est celle de la forme à leur donner. Assurément il y a des institutions que nous pouvons détruire (le travail). D’autres que nous pouvons faire régresser (l’argent). D’autres enfin que nous pouvons métamorphoser. Pour, non pas «\,vivre sans\,», mais vivre différemment." (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is an international public health crisis without precedent in the last century. The novelty and rapid spread of the virus have added a new urgency to the availability and distribution of reliable information to help curb its fatal potential. As seasoned and trusted purveyors of reliable public information, librarians have attempted to respond to the “infodemic” of fake news, disinformation, and propaganda with a variety of strategies, but the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge because of the deadly stakes involved. The seriousness of the current situation requires that librarians and associated professionals re-evaluate the ethical basis of their approach to information provision to counter the growing prominence of conspiracy theories in the public sphere and official decision making. This paper analyzes the conspiracy mindset and specific COVID-19 conspiracy theories in discussing how libraries might address the problems of truth and untruth in ethically sound ways. As a contribution to the re-evaluation we propose, the paper presents an ethical framework based on alethic rights—or rights to truth—as conceived by Italian philosopher Franca D’Agostini and how these might inform professional approaches that support personal safety, open knowledge, and social justice.},

Le concept d'Anthropocène, s'il a le mérite de nommer le problème, peine à identifier les coupables et s'empêtre dans le récit millénaire d'une humanité pyromane. Or si l'on veut comprendre le réchauffement climatique, ce ne sont pas les archives de "l'espèce humaine" qu'il faut sonder mais celles de l'Empire britannique, pour commencer. On y apprend par exemple que dans les années 1830 la vapeur était, aux mains des capitalistes anglais, un outil redoutable pour discipliner la force de travail et une arme de guerre impérialiste ; on y suit la progression fulgurante de la machine mise au point par James Watt qui supplante en quelques années la force hydraulique - pourtant abondante et moins chère - dans l'industrie textile anglaise. En puisant dans les sources de l'histoire sociale, ce livre raconte l'avènement du "capital fossile", ou comment la combustion ininterrompue de charbon a permis de repousser les limites de l'exploitation et du profit. Il faut couper la mèche qui brûle avant que l'étincelle n'atteigne la dynamite, écrivait Walter Benjamin dans un fragment célèbre, "Avertisseur d'incendie", où il insistait sur la nécessité d'en finir avec le capitalisme avant qu'il ne s'autodétruise et emporte tout avec lui. Pour Andreas Malm, on ne peut mieux dire l'urgence contemporaine de défaire l'économie fossile par des mesures révolutionnaires."},

Si les partisans de la mondialisation ont d'abord cru que les outils numériques contribueraient à la diffusion du modèle libéral, force est de constater que l'information crée des vulnérabilités nouvelles qui peuvent compromettre le fonctionnement de la démocratie. Au XXIe siècle plus qu'auparavant, la puissance des États se fonde sur le contrôle de l'information et sur leur capacité à influencer des audiences extérieures et à diffuser leur interprétation du monde. L'étude des guerres de l'information à l'ère numérique permet de comprendre comment différents États, démocratiques ou autoritaires, se servent de l'information pour accroître leur influence et redessiner les équilibres de pouvoir sur la scène internationale. De la présentation de la dimension technique des manipulations de l'information à l'exploration des doctrines et des pratiques de dix pays suivant une grille d'analyse commune, cet ouvrage propose une approche globale et des comparaisons inédites avant de s'interroger sur les effets de la désinformation et les possibilités de régulation par le droit."

In response, this paper investigates 3,073,351 citations found by these six data sources to 2,515 English-language highly-cited documents published in 2006 from 252 subject categories, expanding and updating the largest previous study. Google Scholar found 88\% of all citations, many of which were not found by the other sources, and nearly all citations found by the remaining sources (89–94\%). A similar pattern held within most subject categories. Microsoft Academic is the second largest overall (60\% of all citations), including 82\% of Scopus citations and 86\% of WoS citations. In most categories, Microsoft Academic found more citations than Scopus and WoS (182 and 223 subject categories, respectively), but had coverage gaps in some areas, such as Physics and some Humanities categories. After Scopus, Dimensions is fourth largest (54\% of all citations), including 84\% of Scopus citations and 88\% of WoS citations. It found more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and displays some coverage gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI is the smallest, with 28\% of all citations. Google Scholar is still the most comprehensive source.

  abstract = {Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has placed online learning, blended or hybrid provision as the "new normal" in Higher Education. For most universities and their academic libraries, especially those with a less strong online presence, the pandemic has caused numerous challenges. However, it has also been a catalyst for change and resifting of priorities. For academic librarians involved in the delivery of information skills/literacy training, a renewed mission is emerging, addressing access and connectivity to resources, designing for online education and fostering the development of digital literacy of students. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper based on the author's personal experiences and subjective opinion as a Library and Information Science educator with considerable expertise in online distance learning in the UK. Reflecting critically on the impact of the pandemic from an educational point of view and on key changes experienced, the paper centres on the argument that academic librarians could emerge as strategic partners in Higher Education, towards the direction of enhancing students' digital competences development. Findings The complete and involuntary shift to online learning due to COVID-19 restrictions has opened the door to multiple challenges in Higher Education, which are complex and ongoing: the implementation of remote tools and practices en masse in online teaching and learning in a way that ensures accessibility and equity for all, issues connecting to online pedagogy and how to prepare students with the information and digital literacy competences required for the new online learning "normal". As academic libraries move forward, they have a renewed mission to help learners in the online space to become both information rich and digitally competent. There is an opportunity to act as the connecting link that will help to move a step forward a strategic vision that places design for equity at the centre of education. Originality/value The impact of COVID-19 within Higher Education and academic libraries more specifically, is a theme that has not been yet sufficiently discussed, researched or critically debated as the world is still currently going through the pandemic crisis. This paper aims to initiate some early thoughts and conversation, as well as put forward the author's personal critical positioning on the issues, challenges and potential opportunities, emerging in the current educational climate for academic librarians, and to highlight areas of importance for the design and direction of information and library science curricula.},

  abstract = {BioSharing (http://www.biosharing.org) is a manually curated, searchable portal of three linked registries. These resources cover standards (terminologies, formats and models, and reporting guidelines), databases, and data policies in the life sciences, broadly encompassing the biological, environmental and biomedical sciences. Launched in 2011 and built by the same core team as the successful MIBBI portal, BioSharing harnesses community curation to collate and cross-reference resources across the life sciences from around the world. BioSharing makes these resources findable and accessible (the core of the FAIR principle). Every record is designed to be interlinked, providing a detailed description not only on the resource itself, but also on its relations with other life science infrastructures. Serving a variety of stakeholders, BioSharing cultivates a growing community, to which it offers diverse benefits. It is a resource for funding bodies and journal publishers to navigate the metadata landscape of the biological sciences; an educational resource for librarians and information advisors; a publicising platform for standard and database developers/curators; and a research tool for bench and computer scientists to plan their work. BioSharing is working with an increasing number of journals and other registries, for example linking standards and databases to training material and tools. Driven by an international Advisory Board, the BioSharing user-base has grown by over 40\% (by unique IP address), in the last year thanks to successful engagement with researchers, publishers, librarians, developers and other stakeholders via several routes, including a joint RDA/Force11 working group and a collaboration with the International Society for Biocuration. In this article, we describe BioSharing, with a particular focus on community-led curation.Database URL: https://www.biosharing.org.},

Il était donc indispensable de réinventer la façon dont les référentiels de compétences abordent le numérique. L’UNESCO ou la Commission européenne ont pris cette voie, tout comme le Québec, et ont décidé d’associer des compétences de haut niveau (ex. la pensée critique, la culture de l’information) à la compétence numérique, pour que celle-ci ne se limite pas à des habiletés instrumentales telles qu’allumer un ordinateur, ouvrir son fureteur et se rendre sur un moteur de recherche. La compétence numérique est en fait une nécessité sociétale dont il faut prendre la mesure pour ne pas créer de nouvelles fractures. Quelques situations pédagogiques au postsecondaire permettent d’illustrer la façon dont la compétence numérique peut être abordée dans différentes matières.}

  abstract = {Prior research suggests that Twitter users in the United States are more politically engaged and more partisan compared to the American citizenry -- a public that is otherwise characterized by low levels of political knowledge and disinterest in political affairs. This study seeks to understand this disconnect by conducting an observational analysis of the most popular accounts on American Twitter. We identify opinion leaders by drawing a random sample of ordinary American Twitter users and observing whom they follow. We estimate the ideological leaning and political relevance of these opinion leaders as well as crowd-source how they are perceived by ordinary Americans. We find little evidence that American Twitter is as politicized as is made out to be, with politics and hard news outlets constituting a small subset of these opinion leaders. We find no evidence of polarization among these opinion leaders either. While certain professional categories such as political pundits and political figures are more polarized than others, the overall polarization dissipates further when we factor in the rate at which the opinion leaders tweet: a large number of vocal non-partisan opinion leaders drowns out the partisan voices on the platform. Our results suggest that the degree to which Twitter is political, has likely been overstated in the past. Our findings have implications about how we use Twitter to represent public opinion in the United States.},

  abstract = {The scientific consensus on human-caused global warming has been a topic of intense interest in recent decades. This is in part due to the important role of public perception of expert consensus, which has downstream impacts on public opinion and support for mitigation policies. Numerous studies, using diverse methodologies and measures of climate expertise, have quantified the scientific consensus, finding between 90\% and 100\% agreement on human-caused global warming with multiple studies converging on 97\% agreement. This study revisits the consensus among geoscientists ten years after an initial survey of experts, while exploring different ways to define expertise and the level of agreement among these groups. We sent 10 929 invitations to participate in our survey to a verified email list of geosciences faculty at reporting academic and research institutions and received 2780 responses. In addition to analyzing the raw survey results, we independently quantify how many publications self-identified climate experts published in the field of climate change research and compare that to their survey response on questions about climate change. As well as a binary approach classifying someone as ‘expert’ or ‘non-expert’, we also look at expertise as a scale. We find that agreement on anthropogenic global warming is high (91\% to 100\%) and generally increases with expertise. Out of a group of 153 independently confirmed climate experts, 98.7\% of those scientists indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Among those with the highest level of expertise (independently confirmed climate experts who each published 20+ peer reviewed papers on climate change between 2015 and 2019) there was 100\% agreement that the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.},

Chef d'oeuvre d'inventivité et de drôlerie, Le Dévoué est aussi un grand roman politique sur l'identité et sur l'Histoire qui n'en finit pas de nous rattraper. Paris, été 1981 Après avoir réchappé d'un camp de rééducation, Vo Danh (l'homme sans nom, l'espion, l'agent double à la solde des communistes, héros et narrateur du Sympathisant) atterrit à Paris en même temps qu'une cohorte de réfugiés vietnamiens. Il est accompagné de Bon, son frère de sang, toujours aussi résolument anti-communiste (et ignorant de la double identité de Vo Danh). Tous deux logés dans le 11ème arrondissement de Paris, ils se lancent à l'assaut de la capitale bien décidés à faire leur trou et surtout à se remettre de leurs émotions. Hélas, Le Boss, leur seul contact à Paris, n'est autre qu'un trafiquant notoire qui leur offre en guise de job, de devenir ses hommes de main, chargés de régler leur compte aux mauvais payeurs et autres resquilleurs. Bien trop sensible pour supporter toute cette violence, Vo Danh propose au Boss de se lancer dans un trafic de cannabis auprès des intellectuels de gauche et autres philosophes marxistes. Un business plus tranquille et plus lucratif. Du moins le croit-il, car très vite, il se retrouve au coeur d'une brutale lutte de territoire entre dealers algériens. Et comme si tout cela ne suffisait pas, Bon et lui apprennent une incroyable nouvelle : l'homme masqué, leur tortionnaire au camp de rééducation, serait lui aussi à Paris et occuperait un poste important à l'ambassade du Vietnam. Pour Vo Danh qui pensait couler des jours heureux à Paris, boire des crèmes en terrasse tout en se goinfrant de croissant, les ennuis ne font que commencer..." (Editeur)},

  abstract = {Qui est ce groupe d’individus sans conscience de classe qui critique la société de consommation tout en permettant au système de perdurer ? Les « enfants gâtés », comme les nomme l’anthropologue Fanny Parise, jouent-ils le rôle qu’ils prétendent jouer – celui de réformer un système destructeur – ou participent-ils malgré eux à la reproduction du système et de ses inégalités socioculturelles ? L’enjeu de cet ouvrage est de faire le point sur le mythe de la contre-culture postcapitaliste : pour commencer, qu’a-t-elle de « post » capitaliste, précisément, cette contre-culture ? Et comment ce mythe amène-t-il insidieusement à passer de l’injonction « consommer mieux et moins » à celle de « consommer mieux et plus » ? Vous allez adorer détester les enfants gâtés : ils sont toujours l’autre, mais chacun de nous peut se reconnaître par certains aspects en eux. Faites-vous partie de ces influenceurs qui s’ignorent dont l’objectif la plupart du temps inconscient est de continuer à consommer comme avant sans passer pour un suppôt écocide du grand capital ?

Ils sont peu ou pas diplômés et exercent des métiers qui ne demandent pas d'usage de l'informatique. Pourtant, ils se sont pleinement emparés d'internet et en ont fait un instrument de leur vie quotidienne. La recherche en ligne leur a ouvert un monde jusque-là hors de portée : elle leur permet de percer le mystère des termes médicaux, leur fournit des armes pour l'aide scolaire aux enfants, leur ouvre de nouvelles activités. Des biens et des services, auxquels il leur était impossible d'accéder avant dans ces zones rurales, sont à portée de clic, à des prix imbattables. Internet est aussi un lieu de parole et de réconfort : dans l'entre soi des comptes Facebook sont confiés aux proches les drames de la vie en milieu populaire - le célibat subi, la perte d'emploi, les incertitudes du travail précaire. Mais cette aventure a un coût. Ces outils, dont le potentiel d'individualisation est fort, fragilisent la vie collective familiale en multipliant les « moments à soi » entre conjoints et en rendant le contrôle de la sociabilité des enfants impossible. Les achats en ligne contribuent à détruire le petit commerce et à désertifier l'environnement immédiat. Les relations électroniques avec Pôle Emploi ou la CAF tournent souvent au cauchemar et transforment l'État providence en État tourmenteur. Fondée sur des entretiens et l'analyse approfondie de comptes Facebook, cette recherche sur les classes populaires non précaires, éclaire la tension constante entre ouverture et risque que représente la course à la modernité électronique.},

  abstract = {Background/purpose Scoping review design represents a methodology that allows assessment of emerging evidence, as well as a first step in research development. Despite its increasing use, to date no article reflecting use of scoping review methodology has been submitted for review at JAANP. The purpose of this article is to provide detailed information on scoping reviews, including definition, related processes, and uses, and discuss the relationship to nurse practitioner (NP) practice, policy, education, and research. The longer-term goal is that NPs will understand the related techniques, consider the methodology as a viable one for NP scholarship, and bring related reports to the forefront of NP publications. Methods This manuscript represents a brief report. Processes to develop the brief include detailed search and review of scoping review literature in CINAHL and PubMed. Both methodologic reports and reviews were included. Definitions and uses of scoping reviews were reviewed. Conclusion The definition and process of scoping review are evolving. Although there is controversy regarding the methodology, there is increasing visibility of scoping review methodology in the published literature since the year 2000, with over 500 published reviews currently available. Implications for practice A well-executed scoping review has potential to inform NP practice, policy, education, and research.},

They gleefully whip the media into a frenzy over a fake teen drug crisis; they post offensive messages on Facebook memorial pages, traumatizing grief-stricken friends and family; they use unabashedly racist language and images. They take pleasure in ruining a complete stranger's day and find amusement in their victim's anguish. In short, trolling is the obstacle to a kinder, gentler Internet. To quote a famous Internet meme, trolling is why we can't have nice things online. Or at least that's what we have been led to believe. In this provocative book, Whitney Phillips argues that trolling, widely condemned as obscene and deviant, actually fits comfortably within the contemporary media landscape. Trolling may be obscene, but, Phillips argues, it isn't all that deviant. Trolls' actions are born of and fueled by culturally sanctioned impulses—which are just as damaging as the trolls' most disruptive behaviors. Phillips describes, for example, the relationship between trolling and sensationalist corporate media—pointing out that for trolls, exploitation is a leisure activity; for media, it's a business strategy. She shows how trolls, “the grimacing poster children for a socially networked world,” align with social media. And she documents how trolls, in addition to parroting media tropes, also offer a grotesque pantomime of dominant cultural tropes, including gendered notions of dominance and success and an ideology of entitlement. We don't just have a trolling problem, Phillips argues; we have a culture problem. This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things isn't only about trolls; it's about a culture in which trolls thrive.},

  abstract = {Que se passe-t-il quand un outil qui a été élaboré et d’abord utilisé par les classes moyennes et supérieures diplômées est approprié par des individus qu’on a souvent décrits comme les exclus de la révolution numérique ? C’est la question que pose ce dossier de Réseaux coordonné par Dominique Pasquier. Il y a de nombreux travaux sur Internet, mais ils s’intéressent d’abord aux usages avancés des plus diplômés. Il y a de nombreux travaux sur les classes populaires, mais ils prêtent une attention marginale à la pénétration des nouvelles technologies dans les populations qu’ils étudient. Pourtant, depuis une dizaine d’années, les inégalités sociales d’accès à Internet se sont largement résorbées. En France, entre 2006 et 2015, la proportion d’employés ayant une connexion Internet à domicile est passée de 51 à 88 \%, celle des ouvriers de 38 à 83 \% (rapport CREDOC 2015). Ces populations peu ou pas diplômées ont elles les mêmes utilisations de l’outil que les jeunes urbains très qualifiés sur lesquels se sont penchées jusqu’ici la plupart des recherches ? Rien n’est moins certain. Internet est un outil très polyvalent qui donne accès à des dispositifs socio techniques dotés d’une grande plasticité. Les usages en ligne de ces nouveaux venus sur le web ne doivent pas se mesurer à l’aune des pratiques innovantes d’internautes plus anciens. Ils font sens par rapport à un éthos social et des conditions de vie particulières. Internet ne fait pas partie de leur univers professionnel et ils s’y sont formés de façon autodidacte, avec plus ou moins de difficultés. Il peut être à la fois un puissant instrument d’ouverture sur le monde et d’entrée dans la société de connaissance et constituer une menace en bouleversant certains modes de vie. L’outil est là comme une opportunité à saisir et comme un risque à courir. Les recherches présentées dans ce dossier montrent que l’Internet des moins dotés n’est pas un Internet au rabais : il répond à des logiques propres, résout des problèmes particuliers, engendre des pratiques spécifiques.

Ce wiki fait partie d’un cours en ligne à l’Université TÉLUQ. Il peut être consulté à l’adresse suivante : http://wiki.teluq.ca/ted6210/index.php/Bienvenue\_dans\_Wiki-TEDia. Le projet Wiki-TEDia s’inscrit dans la démarche SoTL soutenue par la méthodologie de la recherche-design. Il se trouve actuellement au début de l’étape de l’évaluation de la première phase de l’itération prévue. Cette première phase s’est déroulée entre 2012 et 2018. La première année a été consacrée à l’idéation et la conception du wiki dans le cadre d’un cours en ligne de 2e cycle. Les cinq années suivantes, le wiki a été ouvert aux étudiants du cours et à tous les employés et les étudiants de la TÉLUQ.   Dans ce chapitre, je présente d’abord quelques considérations théoriques sur les usages des wikis en enseignement supérieur en général, et, en formation à distance en particulier. Par la suite, je décris la première phase du projet,  principalement l’inspiration théorique, l’idéation et la conception du wiki. Une fois démarré, le contenu de Wiki-TEDia a été construit et amélioré progressivement par 124 étudiants du cours dont il fait partie. Ces étudiants ont démontré non seulement leur implication dans leurs études, mais aussi leur professionnalisme en participant à l’élaboration des connaissances utiles pour les professionnels de l’éducation . Sans leur participation, je n’aurai évidemment pas pu progresser dans la réflexion sur ma pratique d’enseignement avec le wiki, dont je dresse les contours dans la conclusion de ce chapitre.},

Methods             Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up were conducted.                                   Results             Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 0.37, 95\%CI 0.12 to 1.13, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95\%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality in three RCTs at high RoB was reduced with IVM. Sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs with follow up {$<$}21 days showed no difference in all-cause mortality.                                   Conclusions             In comparison to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.},

In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N\,=\,15,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design. We provide initial evidence that people’s ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after gameplay, irrespective of education, age, political ideology, and cognitive style.},

Nous nous mettons alors à espérer un monde plus juste qui adviendrait grâce au retour de l’État providence, à la prise en compte des questions écologiques et à une participation citoyenne accrue. Un véritable paysage de carte postale en somme. Or, rien de cela ne nous sauvera du pouvoir des algorithmes, de la marchandisation intégrale de nos vies par l’industrie numérique, ou du déploiement d’une télésocialité contribuant à notre « isolement collectif ». Autant de processus qui engendrent de nouveaux types d’assujettissement, ignorés de la « grande politique ». Si nous savons que l’enjeu majeur de notre époque est d’être partie prenante des affaires qui nous regardent, cette aspiration prend des formes trop éparses, ne répondant à aucun projet commun défini en ce sens. À contre-courant de cette tendance, ce livre renouvelle les perspectives d’émancipation, en dressant un registre d’actions concrètes. Cela suppose de mener une critique des discours défendant des intérêts privés, de ne plus subir de situations iniques et de constituer un foisonnement de collectifs – dans tous les domaines de la vie – favorisant l’expérimentation, la meilleure expression de chacun, tout en étant soucieux de ne léser ni personne, ni la biosphère. Après tant de désillusions, le moment est venu de ne plus nous en remettre à des instances tierces pour nous engager dans une impérieuse et salutaire politique de nous-mêmes. (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {We add richness and depth to investor decision-making research by exploring the influence of entrepreneurs' use of ingratiation rhetoric in their investor pitch presentations on investor funding decisions. Drawing on ingratiation theory, we model the effects of flattery, self-deprecation, opinion conformity, and self-promotion as distinct forms of ingratiation rhetoric. We do so independently and in tandem, conceptualizing the confluence of ingratiation forms as driving an overall aggregate effect on the amount of funding allocated by investors. We then theorize that entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance are moderators of the aggregate effect. We test our model in the angel investment context with data from 789 entrepreneur pitch presentations to 27 investors on the Shark Tank television program from 2009 through 2020. We find that on their own, the different forms of ingratiation rhetoric have mixed effects, with flattery and self-deprecation negatively impacting investor funding amount and opinion conformity and self-promotion positively relating to funding amount. When used together, we find an overall negative effect, and this effect is positively moderated by entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance. These findings shed new light on ingratiation rhetoric as a powerful force in entrepreneurs' efforts to secure funding.},

  abstract = {Originally marginal, participatory research has become an increasingly important methodology in the social, biophysical, and interdisciplinary sciences. The overall increase in publications based on participatory research has raised questions about crediting the contributions of nonacademic collaborators. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, we analyzed trends and patterns in authorship and acknowledgment practices in a sample of 262 journal articles reporting on participatory research on rural livelihoods published from 1975 to 2013. Six percent of the researchers recognized the intellectual contributions of their nonacademic collaborators with coauthorship and 51 percent with acknowledgment. Through interviews with lead authors of coauthored articles, we analyzed factors that shaped whether authorship was shared with nonacademic collaborators. Despite facing numerous barriers, researchers were motivated to coauthor in order to recognize intellectual contributions, practice research ethics, and work toward epistemic decolonization. We argue that coauthorship can be an important component of epistemic justice in participatory research and encourage participatory researchers to discuss authorship with their nonacademic collaborators as a routine component of engaged scholarship. We also note that nonacademics’ contributions to scientific knowledge need to be taken into account in understandings of the practice of science.},

  abstract = {Alongside the growing concerns regarding predatory journal growth, other questionable editorial practices have gained visibility recently. Among them, we explored the usefulness of the Percentage of Papers by the Most Prolific author (PPMP) and the Gini index (level of inequality in the distribution of authorship among authors) as tools to identify journals that may show favoritism in accepting articles by specific authors. We examined whether the PPMP, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using all articles in a sample of 5,468 biomedical journals indexed in the National Library of Medicine. For articles published between 2015 and 2019, the median PPMP was 2.9\%, and 5\% of journal exhibited a PPMP of 10.6\% or more. Among the journals with the highest PPMP or Gini index values, where a few authors were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications, a random sample was manually examined, revealing that the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61\%). The papers by the most prolific authors were more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their submission. Results of analysis on a subset of articles, excluding nonresearch articles, were consistent with those of the principal analysis. In most journals, publications are distributed across a large number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be transparent about their editorial and peer review practices.},

  abstract = {Internet a été salué comme un formidable outil de démocratie participative. On lui reconnait un rôle essentiel dans les mobilisations des Printemps arabes ou de Occupy Wall Street, et l'émergence de mouvements tels que Black Lives Matter ou \#MeToo. Son image s'est toutefois dégradée à mesure que les réseaux sociaux ont été pointés du doigt pour leur participation à la propagation des fake news. Jen Schradie, chercheuse à Sciences Po, montre comment le web est devenu une arme nouvelle dans l'arsenal des mouvements conservateurs. Sur la base de la situation américaine, elle met en évidence trois facteurs déterminants dans la propagation des idées de droite sur internet : la fracture sociale, exacerbée sur le web, l'organisation hiérarchisée et les moyens financiers engagés par des partis de droite, et la nature même des messages relayés. Elle épluche les différentes couches de la surmédiatisation et met ainsi à jour un terrain numérique inégal, largement délaissé par la classe populaire, au profit de groupes réformistes de droite aux avant-postes du cybermilitantisme. L'analyse d'un système interconnecté d'organisations communautaires et professionnelles de droite lui permet de réfuter les récentes allégations selon lesquelles des individus comme Trump, des réseaux d'informations comme Breitbart, des plateformes comme Google ou encore des pays comme la Russie seraient les seuls responsables de la situation actuelle. En parallèle de l'émergence de mouvements comme \#NuitDebout ou des Gilets jaunes, la montée en popularité d'Éric Zemmour confirme que la France n'est pas épargnée par le phénomène. A l'heure où l'activisme hashtag fait les gros titres, le cybermilitantisme radical s'avère redoutablement efficace. Il accélère et renforce les rapports de classe et la polarisation idéologique de nos sociétés (4e de couverture)},

Ce manuel propose une introduction à la programmation Python destinée aux étudiants et praticiens en SHS. Python est un langage de programmation simple, libre, multi-plateforme, pédagogique, bénéficiant d'une communauté d'utilisateurs croissante tant dans le domaine universitaire que le secteur privé. Avec la multiplication des données numériques dans les sciences humaines et sociales (SHS), le recours à l'informatique devient indispensable tant pour la collecte, la mise en forme, ou le traitement des données. Le langage Python permet à la fois de réaliser les traitements statistiques habituels des SHS tout en ouvrant aux nouveaux usages liés à l'automatisation des tâches informatiques, le traitement des grands corpus des humanités numériques ou encore la collecte de données sur les réseaux sociaux. Ce manuel se concentre en priorité sur les usages du traitement des données en SHS. Complété avec de nombreux exemples de code et des études de cas concrets, l'ouvrage permet une familiarisation progressive à la programmation, au langage Python et à sa philosophie. Il insiste sur sa flexibilité pour répondre aux besoins de chaque problématique tout en soulignant l'importance de la diffusion et de la reproductibilité des traitements informatiques (4e de couverture.)},

La société nouvelle, globalisée, est en effet dominée par ce que Tocqueville aurait pu appeler le "Monstre doux", le modèle tentaculaire et diffus d'une culture puissamment attirante, au visage à la fois souriant et sinistre, qui promet satisfaction et bien-être à tous en s'assurant de l'endormissement des conciences par la possession et la consommation tout en entretenant la confusion en fiction et réalité."},

This chapter addresses this gap by developing an understanding of political information literacy and challenges the premise that information professionals and information organizations should remain neutral in the face of phenomena like censorship through noise and disinformation. In this endeavor, it reviews contemporary information environments vis-à-vis the growth of fake news and misinformation, and current information literacy approaches utilized by information organizations. Thereafter, it explores several cognitive barriers, such as the role of confirmation bias, information avoidance, information groupishness, and information overload, which affects people’s ability to process information. Finally, it encourages information professionals to hold regular information sessions on politically charged topics, tackle the cognitive factors increasing misinformation, and cultivate multidisciplinary approaches to confront fake news.},

  abstract = {FAIR data principles represent a set of community-agreed guiding principles and practices for all researchers involved in the eScience ecosystem. The FAIR data principles were created to improve the reuse of data by making it findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The goal of these principles is to ensure that the inputs and outputs from computational analysis can be easily found and understood by data consumers, both humans and machines. Since the introduction of FAIR Data Principles in 2016, the interest in these principles has been constantly increasing and several research groups have started developing tools for evaluation of data FAIRness. In this paper, we aim to analyze the available online tools and checklists for data FAIRness evaluation and to provide tool comparison based on multiple features. Taking into account this analysis and tools advantages and disadvantages, we provide recommendations about the tools usage. A FAIRness practical evaluation is also conducted on seven data sets from different data repositories using the analysed tools. Findings show that there are no commonly accepted requirements evaluation of data FAIRness. The conclusions of this study could be used for further improvement of the FAIRness criteria design and making FAIR feasible in daily practice.},

  abstract = {Due to the incremental nature of scientific discovery, scientific writing requires extensive referencing to the writings of others. The accuracy of this referencing is vital, yet errors do occur. These errors are called ‘quotation errors’. This paper presents the first assessment of quotation errors in high-impact general science journals. A total of 250 random citations were examined. The propositions being cited were compared with the referenced materials to verify whether the propositions could be substantiated by those materials. The study found a total error rate of 25\%. This result tracks well with error rates found in similar studies in other academic fields. Additionally, several suggestions are offered that may help to decrease these errors and make similar studies more feasible in the future.}

  abstract = {Jeffrey Beall, a US librarian, coined the term “predatory publishing” specifically to describe a movement or phenomenon of open access (OA) journals and publishers that he and others believed displayed exploitative and unscholarly principles. Using a blog to transmit those ideas, and profiling specific cases using blacklists, one of the most polemic aspects of Beall's blog was its tendency to attract and incite academic radicalism. Beall targeted both publishers and standalone journals, but how he precisely determined that an OA journal or a publisher was predatory was in many cases an ambiguity. Beall's deficient and highly subjective criteria, as well as those blacklists' incapacity to clearly distinguish low quality OA publishers from predatory ones, may have negatively impacted the operations of several Beall-blacklisted OA journals and publishers. Freedom of speech that embraces prejudice, via Beall's blog, and the establishment of “predatory” blacklists, are enhanced discriminatory ideologies that continue to be carried downstream from Beall to and by other like-minded individuals and groups who proliferate academic divisiveness and may also be formalizing and institutionalizing a culture of discriminative philosophies by cloning Beall's blacklists and encouraging their continued use.},

Quelques mois plus tard, l'épidémie de Covid-19 offrait, à l'échelle mondiale, un cas d'usage frappant des dispositifs que je m'étais efforcé de décrire.On a vu des officines de toutes tailles, hier positionnées sur le juteux secteur de la sécurité, pivoter vers un nouvel impératif, celui de la traque des corps malades – un levier encore plus puissant que la lutte contre le terrorisme. Des applications de traçage, de "suivi des contacts', ont été développées un peu partout, misant sur le numérique pour endiguer la course du virus. Dans le ciel, des drones sortis d'un futur proche ont fait respecter le confinement. On a confié à des caméras le soin de s'assurer du port du masque et du respect de la distanciation sociale.La crise sanitaire a mis au jour la présence de ces dispositifs de surveillance toujours plus nombreux, dont elle a dans le même temps assis la légitimité et accéléré la banalisation. On me demande souvent s'il faut craindre la généralisation d'une surveillance dite de masse ; et s'il s'agissait plutôt d'une massification de la surveillance ? "Olivier Tesquet},

Avant, les firmes ne considéraient pas le harcèlement sexuel comme un problème social majeur. Mais, en juin 1997, la révision de la loi de 1985 sur l’égalité des chances en matière d’emploi va introduire, à la charge de l’employeur, une obligation de vigilance et de prévention sur le lieu de travail. Cet article se propose d’abord de retracer le processus qui a conduit à cet amendement, en correspondance avec les avancées doctrinales et les développements de la jurisprudence japonaise, tant sur le plan de la responsabilité délictuelle que de la responsabilité contractuelle. Il traite également du rôle joué par le ministère de la Santé, du Travail et de la Protection Sociale en vue d’assurer l’effectivité de la loi par le biais des directives administratives. Il s’interroge enfin, sur la base d’enquêtes conduites par l’administration du travail et la Fondation du travail pour le XXIe siècle, sur l’attitude des firmes, hésitant entre indifférence et action constructive.},

The aim of this article is to present some of the digital tools that increase the efficiency of scientific research and facilitate conceptual work, information retrieval, note-taking and writing up of research.  Approach/Methods: The research process comprised several stages, each of which focused on a specific tool that directly increases work efficiency and performs functions beyond human capabilities.  Results and conclusions: The latest digital tools are equipped with features that increase efficiency at all stages of the research process. They speed up the completion of a task (e.g. searching for information) and illuminate the relationships between documents or individual concepts that researchers themselves would not register (e.g. through the visualization of data and information).  Originality/Value: The skillful use of modern digital tools is a fundamental element of digital wisdom as computer programs and Web applications significantly broaden human perception and cognitive capabilities.},

  abstract = {The design of graphical user interfaces has been evolving from skeuomorph interfaces – which use elements that mimic the aesthetics and functionality of their real-world counterparts – to minimalist and flat designs. Despite the growing popularity of these new design approaches, they can be challenging for older adults who experience a decline in visual and cognitive abilities. Still, little is known about user performance, aesthetic perception, and preference of older adults, particularly in comparison to younger users and traditional skeuomorph interfaces. In this paper, we examine the performance and aesthetic perception of older (65–77 years old) and younger (20–40) adults with three design approaches: skeuomorph, skeuominimalist, and flat design. Results show flat design is either slower or less accurate than traditional skeuomorph interfaces for older adults across three tasks: visual search, identifying clickable objects, and multiple page navigation. Younger adults were less susceptible to performance differences between design approaches, but still subject to ‘click uncertainty’ with flat interfaces. Skeuominimalism did not show clear performance benefits over flat design or skeuomorphism, while the latter reduced the performance gap between age groups. Finally, younger adults preferred the simplicity of skeuominimalism, while older adults preferred skeuomorph interfaces because of the perceived usability, beauty, and trustiness.},

Dans les entretiens d'embauche comme dans les rendez-vous galants. Pas un jour ne passe sans que nous ayons à défendre une idée, un projet, un produit ; et à nous protéger contre d'éventuelles fourberies. Que cela nous plaise ou non, convaincre est un pouvoir. A nous d'apprendre à le maîtriser. Et de savoir y résister. Car la rhétorique n'est ni innée, ni inexplicable. Elle repose sur une technique, obéit à des règles, mobilise des procédés, des stratagèmes, des outils. Dans ce traité accessible et concret, ponctué d'exemples et de cas pratiques, Clément Viktorovitch nous en révèle tous les secrets. Au fil des pages, il nous montre comment produire et décrypter les discours, mener les débats et les discussions, déjouer les manipulations. L'art de convaincre est un pouvoir trop grand pour ne pas être partagé ! (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {Mass selection into groups of like-minded individuals may be fragmenting and polarizing online society, particularly with respect to partisan differences1–4. However, our ability to measure the social makeup of online communities and in turn, to understand the social organization of online platforms, is limited by the pseudonymous, unstructured and large-scale nature of digital discussion. Here we develop a neural-embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online communities along social dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 5.1 billion comments made in 10,000 communities over 14 years on Reddit, we measure how the macroscale community structure is organized with respect to age, gender and US~political partisanship. Examining political content, we find that Reddit underwent a significant polarization event around the 2016 US~presidential election. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, individual-level polarization is rare; the system-level shift in 2016 was disproportionately driven by the arrival of new users. Political polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the platform and is instead temporally aligned with external events. We also observe a stark ideological asymmetry, with the sharp increase in polarization in 2016 being entirely attributable to changes in right-wing activity. This methodology is broadly applicable to the study of online interaction, and our findings have implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the social contexts of online behaviour, and quantifying the dynamics and mechanisms of online polarization.},

Belief ‘choice’ is subject to an important constraint, however: people can only bring themselves to believe things for which they can find rationalizations. When preferences for similar beliefs are widespread, this constraint generates rationalization markets, social structures in which agents compete to produce rationalizations in exchange for money and social rewards. I explore the nature of such markets, I draw on political media to illustrate their characteristics and behaviour, and I highlight their implications for understanding motivated cognition and misinformation.},

Nous nous savons tous exposés aux mêmes risques : changement climatique, crise économique et écologique, épidémies, terrorismes, etc. Mais alors qu’elle s’impose dans les consciences, l’unité de l’humanité recule dans les représentations : revendications identitaires, nationalismes, xénophobies, radicalités religieuses. L’universel est accusé de toutes parts : il serait oublieux des particularismes et des différences, en somme il serait trop universel. Ou il ne le serait pas assez, il ne serait que le masque du plus fort : du patriarcat (tous les hommes, mais pas les femmes), de l’Occident (tous les hommes, mais seulement les Blancs), ou de l’anthropocentrisme (tous les hommes, mais pas les animaux). Contre ces replis, il faut que les idées universalistes retrouvent leur puissance mobilisatrice et critique. Contre la dictature des émotions et des opinions, défendre la raison scientifique. Contre l’empire des identités, refonder une éthique de l’égalité et de la réciprocité. Sur quoi peut aujourd’hui reposer cet héritage des Lumières ? Ni sur un Dieu, ni sur la Nature, car ils prouvent tout et son contraire. Il faut s’y résoudre : l’humanité est seule source de valeurs. Pour autant, nous ne sommes pas condamnés au relativisme. Car l’humanité, ce n’est pas seulement l’ensemble des êtres humains, c’est aussi la qualité présente en chacun de nous et qui nous lie aux autres : non pas la capacité de communiquer qui est aussi propre à d’autres espèces, ni l’aptitude à raisonner que possèdent certaines machines, mais la faculté de raisonner en communiquant, autrement dit de dialoguer.

Via supervised machine learning, we build four classifiers (logistic regression, KNN, SVM, CNN) using facial images of 1856 real persons controlled for race, gender, age and facial expressions, nearly half of whom were convicted criminals, for discriminating between criminals and non-criminals. All four classifiers perform consistently well and produce evidence for the validity of automated face-induced inference on criminality, despite the historical controversy surrounding the topic. Also, we find some discriminating structural features for predicting criminality, such as lip curvature, eye inner corner distance, and the so-called nose-mouth angle. Above all, the most important discovery of this research is that criminal and non-criminal face images populate two quite distinctive manifolds. The variation among criminal faces is significantly greater than that of the non-criminal faces. The two manifolds consisting of criminal and non-criminal faces appear to be concentric, with the non-criminal manifold lying in the kernel with a smaller span, exhibiting a law of normality for faces of non-criminals. In other words, the faces of general law-biding public have a greater degree of resemblance compared with the faces of criminals, or criminals have a higher degree of dissimilarity in facial appearance than normal people.},

Using tweets that discussed the controversy, we conducted quantitative sentiment analysis to examine skeptical and non-skeptical tones on Twitter. Critiques of and studies refuting the arsenic life hypothesis were publicized on blogs before formal publication in traditional academic spaces and were shared on Twitter, influencing issue salience among a range of audiences. This case exemplifies the role of new media in informal post-publication peer review, which can complement traditional peer review processes.

  abstract = {In higher education, student learning satisfaction is a significant predictor of learning that indicates the commitment students have to their learning and future academic achievement. The study combines the social cognitive career theory (SCCT) and the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model to explore the psychological cognition and attitudes derived from students during their learning, discusses the pattern of student learning satisfaction enhancement from the aspect of process, and further understands the relationships among social support systems, interaction relationships, self-efficacy, generic skills, and learning satisfaction. In this study, 800 valid copies of questionnaires were collected from 12 universities through purposive sampling, and the structural model was analyzed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results showed that the relationships among all the constructs were positive and showed a significant effect; furthermore, the research results showed that self-efficacy and student generic skills had a significantly indirect effect in the model—specifically, a mediating effect. Finally, corresponding theoretical and practical implications were put forward based on the research results.},

  abstract = {As people’s health awareness and standard of living improve, mHealth applications are being increasingly used. However, mHealth application services are mainly based on the collection of personal and behavioral data, which conflicts with users’ growing privacy concerns. In that context, this study considers the privacy paradox phenomenon, in which privacy concerns co-exist with disclosure behavior. This study explores the privacy paradox in mHealth applications using an integrated elaboration likelihood model (ELM) from the perspective of privacy calculus and privacy fatigue. Results from the quasi-experiment and partial least squares structural equation modeling reveal that, compared with privacy concerns, perceived benefits have a greater impact on users’ disclosure intention, which further supports the existence of the privacy paradox in the mHealth context; this process is found to originate in users’ privacy calculus. However, privacy fatigue is found to have an insignificant impact on users’ disclosure intention, which may be due to the low sunk cost of users’ investment in mHealth applications. The results indicate that designers of mHealth applications should optimize their interaction functions to enhance benefits to users.},
